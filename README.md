# Final Year Project - Image Steganography
This is final year project which is based on steganography technique. Steganography -  Stegano(Coverd) + Graphy(Writting) means coverd writting.
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection.It means we can hide the secret massage behind or in the form of Image, Audio, Video and Text document.
This techniques uses in spy agency like Raw, in conversation secretly or sending the massage secretly.

# Built using 
Python Programing Language which is high level and powerfull language.
We have used the many modules, functions and many more things in this project which is given below with decription:
* Stegano Module - Stegano, a pure Python Steganography module.
* tkinter module - Tkinter is a standard GUI (graphical user interface) package. Tkinter is Python's default GUI module and also the most common way that is used for GUI programming in Python. Note that Tkinter is a set of wrappers that implement the Tk widgets as Python classes.
* imageTk Module - The ImageTk module contains support to create and modify Tkinter BitmapImage and PhotoImage objects from PIL images. For examples, see the demo programs in the Scripts directory. A Tkinter-compatible bitmap image. This can be used everywhere Tkinter expects an image object.

We have make a decode function for decoding the image and make a encode function for encoding the message in the form of image.
